I was assigned to two international teams: SEI US and State Street US.\nMy responsibilities included: - Preparing and reviewing second-level funds. - Assisting with fund accounting and compliance checks. - Ensuring timely and accurate documentation for reviewers. - Collaborating with team members across different regions.\nThis experience helped me develop a strong attention to detail, reinforced my ability to work under pressure, and allowed me to gain real-world exposure to large-scale financial operations. It also introduced me to the importance of client-focused work, deadline management, and the importance of teamwork in professional environments.\nMost importantly, my time at Grant Thornton helped solidify my passion for roles that blend finance, strategy, and analytics — and I was grateful to form long-lasting connections with mentors and peers during the placement."
