    "text": "Hello! I’m Liam Cummins, a final-year Business Studies student at Dublin City University (DCU), with a specialisation in Data Analytics. My academic and professional journey has been shaped by a deep interest in strategic thinking, practical problem-solving, and making an impact in the business world through data and insights.\n\n\n\nAfter completing secondary school, I pursued a two-year Post Leaving Certificate course in Business Management at Coláiste Dhúlaigh. This programme played a pivotal role in building my confidence and equipping me with foundational business knowledge — from marketing and management principles to practical applications in real-world scenarios.\nThe course also served as a stepping stone to further education. Thanks to my academic performance, I was offered direct entry into Year 2 of the Business Studies programme at DCU. My time at university has been incredibly rewarding — both academically and personally.\nAt DCU, I’ve chosen to specialise in Data Analytics, an area that bridges strategic business decision-making with technical proficiency. From learning tools like Python and SQL to interpreting data for insights, this specialisation has allowed me to strengthen both my analytical skills and business acumen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring my internship at Grant Thornton, I worked in the FAAS (Financial Accounting and Advisory Services) department. I was assigned to two international teams: SEI US and State Street US.\nMy responsibilities included: - Preparing and reviewing second-level fund financial reports. - Assisting with fund accounting and compliance checks. - Ensuring timely and accurate documentation for reviewers. - Collaborating with team members across different regions.\nThis experience helped me develop a strong attention to detail, reinforced my ability to work under pressure, and allowed me to gain real-world exposure to large-scale financial operations. It also introduced me to the importance of client-focused work, deadline management, and the power of teamwork in professional environments.\nMost importantly, my time at Grant Thornton helped solidify my passion for roles that blend finance, strategy, and analytics — and I was grateful to form long-lasting connections with mentors and peers during the placement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), SQL, Excel\nStrategic Analysis: VRIO Framework, SWOT, Uppsala Model, Bartlett & Ghoshal Framework\nReporting & Communication: Financial reporting, presentation design, collaborative team environments\nOther Interests: Business innovation, marketing strategy, financial technologies, and sustainability in business\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I approach graduation, I’m actively exploring graduate roles in marketing, analytics, or financial strategy. I’m excited to bring my academic learning, technical skills, and real-world experience to a dynamic organisation where I can contribute to growth, solve problems creatively, and continue developing as a professional.\nIn the long term, I aim to work in a role that allows me to combine strategic thinking with data-driven insights — whether that’s in a consultancy, analytics firm, or an innovative in-house business team.\n\n\n\n\n\n📄 View My CV\n🔗 LinkedIn"
