# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hello! I'm **Liam Cummins**, a final-year Business Studies student at **Dublin City University (DCU)**, with a specialisation in **Data Analytics**. My academic and professional journey has been shaped by a deep interest in strategic thinking, practical problem-solving, and making an impact in the business world through data and insights.

## ðŸŽ“ Education Journey

After completing secondary school, I pursued a two-year **Post Leaving Certificate** course in **Business Management** at *ColÃ¡iste DhÃºlaigh*. This programme played a pivotal role in building my confidence and equipping me with foundational business knowledge â€” from marketing and management principles to practical applications in real-world scenarios.

The course also served as a stepping stone to further education. Thanks to my academic performance, I was offered direct entry into **Year 2 of the Business Studies programme at DCU**. My time at university has been incredibly rewarding â€” both academically and personally.

At DCU, Iâ€™ve chosen to specialise in **Data Analytics**, an area that bridges strategic business decision-making with technical proficiency. From learning tools like Python and SQL to interpreting data for insights, this specialisation has allowed me to strengthen both my analytical skills and business acumen.

## ðŸ’¼ Professional Experience

### Finance Intern â€“ *Grant Thornton Ireland*

During my internship at **Grant Thornton**, I worked in the **FAAS (Financial Accounting and Advisory Services)** department. I was assigned to two international teams: **SEI US** and **State Street US**.

My responsibilities included:
- Preparing and reviewing second-level fund financial reports.
- Assisting with fund accounting and compliance checks.
- Ensuring timely and accurate documentation for reviewers.
- Collaborating with team members across different regions.

This experience helped me develop a strong attention to detail, reinforced my ability to work under pressure, and allowed me to gain real-world exposure to large-scale financial operations. It also introduced me to the importance of client-focused work, deadline management, and the power of teamwork in professional environments.

Most importantly, my time at Grant Thornton helped solidify my passion for roles that blend **finance, strategy, and analytics** â€” and I was grateful to form long-lasting connections with mentors and peers during the placement.
