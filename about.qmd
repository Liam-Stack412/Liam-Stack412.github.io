## About me

Hello my name is Liam Cummins, I am a final year studient at Dublin City University (DCU), where I am currently pursuing a, undergraduate degree in Business Studies. 
Before pursuing this course I had completed a two-year Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) course in Business Management at Coláiste Dhúlaigh College of Further Education. I've found my plc to be vital in helping my educational development, specifically in growing my confidence and building a foundation of business knowledge I can apply to the workforce or for further progression.

With the necessary education qualifications, from Coláiste Dhúlaigh, I was offered direct entry into Year 2 of DCU's Business Studies course.
From then on I have completed year 2, conducted an internship with Grant Thornton as part of my year 3, and am on track to graduate year 4, with a chosen specialisim on Data Analytics.

## Professional Experience

### Finance Intern – *Grant Thornton Ireland*

During my internship at Grant Thornton, I worked in the FAAS (Financial Accounting and Advisory Services) department. I was assigned to two international teams: SEI US and State Street US.

My responsibilities included:
- Preparing and reviewing second-level funds.
- Assisting with fund accounting and compliance checks.
- Ensuring timely and accurate documentation for reviewers.
- Collaborating with team members across different regions.

This experience helped me develop a strong attention to detail, reinforced my ability to work under pressure, and allowed me to gain real-world exposure to large-scale financial operations. It also introduced me to the importance of client-focused work, deadline management, and the importance of teamwork in professional environments.

Most importantly, my time at Grant Thornton helped solidify my passion for roles that blend finance, strategy, and analytics — and I was grateful to form long-lasting connections with mentors and peers during the placement.

## Career Goals

In the long term, after I have gain enough valuable experience in the business world, I aim to become an entrepreneur and start my own company that will use business innovation to help the disadvantaged in Ireland and hopefully expand worldwide.
