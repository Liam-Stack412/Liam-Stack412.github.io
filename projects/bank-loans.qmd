## Bank Loan Approval Prediction

## Project Overview

I developed and evaluated machine learning models to predict loan approvals using applicant financial and demographic data.  
The goal was to identify patterns that predict whether an applicant would be approved for a bank loan.

## Models Built

- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Model Performance Comparison

| Model                 | Accuracy (%) | F1-Score |
|------------------------|--------------|----------|
| Random Forest          | 97.9         | 0.98     |
| Decision Tree          | 97.3         | 0.97     |
| Logistic Regression    | 79.9         | 0.79     |
| SVM                    | 62.8         | 0.48     |

## Key takeaways

- Random Forest delivered the best overall performance.
- Logistic Regression served as a simple and interpretable baseline.
- SVM struggled due to dataset characteristics.
- Visualizations helped identify misclassifications and improve understanding of model behaviour.
