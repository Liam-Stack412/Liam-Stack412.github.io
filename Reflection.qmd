## What I Learned

From completing these various projects for this portfolio, I have found it to be a very informative and reflective experience. By utilizing Quarto and Github pages, I was able to effectively write and display my project. 
I developed practical skills in **strategic business analysis**, **machine learning model building**, and **professional project presentation** using Quarto and GitHub Pages.

Working on real-world scenarios, like the Grant Thornton strategy report and the Aquaband Defender marketing plan, helped me bridge the gap between **academic theory** and **business application**.

Additionally, building this ePortfolio strengthened my technical abilities in areas like **website deployment**, **version control with Git**, and **data visualization** — skills that are highly valuable in today’s digital economy.

## Key Challenges

- **Translating Research into Recommendations**:  
  Turning academic frameworks into actionable business strategies was more difficult than I initially expected. It required critical thinking and creativity to move beyond simply summarizing theories.

- **Balancing Technical and Academic Demands**:  
  Managing coding tasks (Python modeling, visualizations) while ensuring the written reports met academic standards was challenging but rewarding.  
  It taught me the importance of **project planning** and **time management**.

- **Team Collaboration**:  
  Particularly during the Grant Thornton group project, coordinating research, writing, and analysis with team members was a critical skill development opportunity.

## What's Next?

As I move toward graduation, I am excited to pursue graduate opportunities in **financial analysis**, **business strategy**, or **data-driven consulting**.  
The skills and experiences captured in this portfolio — from technical modeling to strategic thinking — will serve as a strong foundation for my professional career.

Building this portfolio also helped me realize the importance of **lifelong learning**, especially as technology continues to reshape the world of business.

I look forward to applying these skills in real-world settings, continuously improving, and contributing to organizations that value **innovation, analysis, and strategic insight**.
