## Reflection on Designing My ePortfolio Website

Building this ePortfolio website, proved to be a lengthy assignment, but was a valuable and necessary experience to develop practical skills in web development, project organisation, and digital presentation.  
This reflection focuses specifically on the process of creating, customizing, and deploying my site.

## What I Learned

- **Using Quarto and GitHub Pages**:  
  I learned how to create a static website using Quarto, structure projects into `.qmd` files, and deploy the finished site through GitHub Pages.

- **Version Control with Git**:  
  I gained experience committing changes, managing repositories, and ensuring my project history was well-organized and recoverable through Git version control.

- **Customizing Website Design**:  
  I explored how to modify site appearance using themes, SCSS font imports from Google Fonts (Montserrat), and small layout changes such as columns and grids.

- **Multimedia Integration**:  
  I successfully embedded my Aquaband Defener YouTube video, inserted images related to my projects, and linked downloadable PDFs to enrich my portfolio and demonstrate project outcomes.

## Key Challenges

- **Understanding Quartoâ€™s Structure**:  
  Setting up `_quarto.yml` and correctly linking subpages (especially handling project subsections) initially required careful troubleshooting and attention to syntax.

- **Managing Relative File Paths**:  
  Ensuring images, PDFs, and internal links pointed correctly across the directory structure was challenging, particularly when organizing into folders like `projects/`, `images/`, and `files/`. When relative paths failed, it mean't more time was dedicated to finding the problem for something that would be a considerably minor part of this portfolio.

- **Website Aesthetics and Usability**:  
  Finding the right balance between simplicity and design detail. I had to go through several testings as I often leaned more towards complex design, however I started go for simpler approach that offered more value in transparency.

## Skills Developed

- Creating and configuring a Quarto project website.
- Publishing live websites using GitHub Pages.
- Applying basic HTML and CSS/SCSS for design improvements
- Embedding multimedia content and customising layout.

## Future Improvements

If I had more time, I would explore:
- Utilizing python and SQL in its relationship with Quarto to make more interactive pages.
- Remember pitfalls from previous experience to be better equipt for the next project.
- Consider implementing animation into the slides.

## Overall Reflection

Building this website gave me a deeper appreciation for digital presentation skills and project-based learning. 
It also taught me the importance of attention to detail, organization, and continuous testing when creating my own website porfolio.

This experience has strengthened my confidence in setting up and devloping authentic web pages, a skill I will carry forward into my future career development.
