# Overview
For our Business Strategy group project,we all had to work in teams of six and act as business consultants and assess a company based on their strategic advantages, resources/capabilities and possible weaknesses.This project was year-long and followed four  key stages of strategy consulting: Orientation, Diagnostics, Intervention, and Evaluation

 My group chose Grant Thornton as I have previous experience from working for the firm, and felt my experience and knowledge of this firm would be invaluable to the group.
