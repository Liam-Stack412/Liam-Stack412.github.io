# ðŸ¤– Bank Loan Approval Prediction

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

In this project, I developed machine learning models to predict **bank loan approvals** based on applicant financial and demographic data.

This included data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

## ðŸ›  Technologies and Methods

- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- **Models Built:**
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## ðŸ“Š Results

| Model               | Accuracy (%) | F1-Score |
|---------------------|--------------|----------|
| Random Forest        | 97.9         | 0.98     |
| Decision Tree        | 97.3         | 0.97     |
| Logistic Regression  | 79.9         | 0.79     |
| SVM                  | 62.8         | 0.48     |

- **Random Forest** achieved the best performance overall.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualisations

- ROC Curves for model comparison
- Pie charts showing class distribution
- Confusion matrices to interpret predictions

## ðŸ§  Reflection

This project improved my skills in **machine learning model development**, **model evaluation**, and **interpretation of results for real-world applications**.

It also highlighted the importance of balancing model complexity with interpretability when making decisions in finance and banking.
